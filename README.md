#### additional information ####
Crawl Stone Soup (http://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/) has graphical tiles based upon rltiles (http://rltiles.sourceforge.net/) with many modifications/additions.

Those making these changes have signed off their copyright, returning these tiles to a license similar to "public domain", CC Zero (http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

In an effort to promote sharing of this wonderful resource, this project seeks to periodically package these tiles from Crawl Stone Soup's version control, and provide them in a format easily consumable by other projects.

While every care possible has been taken to separate those tiles released into **CC Zero** from those few who are not yet, if you happen to see a tile incorrectly included in this export, please contact the maintainer (chris dot hamons at gmail dot com).

These tiles could not have been created nor re-licensed without the great work of the Crawl Stone Soup developers/artists.
